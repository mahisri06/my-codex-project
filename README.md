# Portfolio Website

A clean, responsive single-page portfolio built from resume content.

## Customize with your details

Update these placeholders in `index.html`:

- `Your Name`
- Role/title in hero section
- Summary in **About Me**
- Experience bullets in **Experience**
- Projects in **Projects**
- Skill list
- Contact email

Optional: place your resume at `resume.pdf` in the project root so the download button works.

## Run locally

Open `index.html` directly in a browser, or run a static file server.
